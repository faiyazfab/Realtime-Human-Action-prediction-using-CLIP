# Realtime Human Action Recognition using CLIP

## Description
This project implements real-time human action recognition using OpenAI's CLIP model fine-tuned with a custom human action recognition dataset. The model processes webcam input to predict and display human actions based on predefined prompts.

## Features
- Fine-tunes CLIP (ViT-B/32) on a custom dataset with image-action mappings.
- Utilizes PyTorch for training and inference.
- Real-time action classification using a webcam.
- Displays predictions as text overlays on the video feed.

## Dataset
The training dataset consists of images labeled with corresponding human actions. The dataset is provided as a CSV file containing image filenames and their respective labels.

## Installation
### Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Train the Model
Modify the dataset path and run the training script:
```sh
python train.py
```

### Run Real-time Action Recognition
Execute the script to start webcam-based inference:
```sh
python action_recognition.py
```
Press `q` to exit the real-time recognition.

## Training Process
1. Loads the CLIP model and dataset.
2. Fine-tunes the model using image-text embeddings.
3. Saves the trained model as `fine_tuned_clip_vit_b32.pth`.

## Real-time Inference
1. Captures video frames from the webcam.
2. Encodes frames using CLIPâ€™s image processing pipeline.
3. Computes similarity scores between image features and predefined action prompts.
4. Displays the highest probability action on the video feed.

## Example Actions
- `using_laptop`
- `hugging`
- `drinking`
- `texting`

## Model Checkpoint
The fine-tuned model is saved as `fine_tuned_clip_vit_b32.pth` and can be reloaded for inference.

## Future Improvements
- Expand dataset with diverse actions.
- Optimize real-time inference speed.
- Implement multi-person action recognition.
